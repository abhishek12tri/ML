# Yield Prediction:
It is a simple model of agriculture crop yield prediction 
Using soil sample and sensors we have collected many feature of soil samples and tried to predict the maximum yeild that can achieve on that type of soil. For this predicting perpose many research papers are used to work under their guidelines for soil sample one of research paper which I personally folled is https://www.ijsr.in/upload/1648503187Paper%2014.pdf.
After data collection and data generation on the basis of how much the feature of soil sample differ from their required value a regresion model is generated to predict the yield prediction for the same
Libraries:
Pandas, Scikit Learn for generating the model model selection and calculating the mean squared error
# Voice Recognition
In this recognition model, the model is trained to recognize voice of different person. Firstly we have collected different persons
voice data and then converted their voice into spectrogram image of voice. Then after applied a CNN model on those images to recognize voice of different people.
